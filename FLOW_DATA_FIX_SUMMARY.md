# Flow Data Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
Dashboard was showing "No flow data found" and BigQuery location error (US instead of EU).

## Solution
Updated all BigQuery client initializations in overview_tab.py to use location="EU".

## Current Status
- ✅ 508,664 records loaded from 8 nodes
- ✅ Data available: November 2024 to April 2025
- ✅ Flow rates: 0-40.73 L/s across nodes
- ✅ Dashboard can now query and display all sensor data

## To See Data in Dashboard:
1. Restart Streamlit: `streamlit run src/presentation/streamlit/app.py`
2. Select time range that includes data (e.g., "Last Month" for March 2025)
3. Select nodes or "All Nodes" to see flow charts
