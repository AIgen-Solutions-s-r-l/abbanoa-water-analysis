# Synthetic Data Generation Summary

## Overview
Successfully generated and inserted synthetic data for ALL 14 nodes to provide complete coverage from November 13, 2024 to August 6, 2025.

## Data Coverage

### Original Data
- **Start**: November 13, 2024
- **End**: March 31, 2025
- **Duration**: 138 days (from cleaned_data.csv)
- **Nodes with original data**: 4 (NODE01, MONITOR01, MONITOR02, TANK01)

### Complete Synthetic Data Generation
1. **Initial Gap Fill** (4 nodes): Filled gaps for nodes with CSV data
   - NODE01, MONITOR01, MONITOR02, TANK01
   - Records added: 50,688

2. **Full Coverage** (10 additional nodes): Generated complete data for all other nodes
   - INTERCON01-08: 8 interconnection points
   - ZONE01-02: 2 zone meters
   - Records added: 128,160

### Final Coverage
- **Total Nodes**: 14 (ALL nodes in the system)
- **Total Days**: 267 (November 13, 2024 to August 6, 2025)
- **Missing Days**: 0
- **Total Records**: 179,526 (approx. 12,800 records per node)

## Synthetic Data Characteristics

### Data Generation Method
The synthetic data was generated using patterns learned from the historical data:

1. **Hourly Patterns**: Replicated typical daily consumption patterns
2. **Weekend/Weekday Differences**: Applied different patterns for weekends
3. **Seasonal Variations**: Incorporated monthly seasonality factors
4. **Trends**: Applied historical trends to project future values
5. **Random Variation**: Added realistic noise based on historical standard deviations

### Nodes Updated
All 14 nodes in the system now have complete data:

**Distribution & Storage (4 nodes)**:
- **NODE01** (CENTRO_EST) - Distribution node
- **TANK01** (CENTRO_SUD) - Storage tank (11M mÂ³)
- **MONITOR01** (CENTRO_OVEST) - Monitoring point 
- **MONITOR02** (CENTRO_NORD) - Monitoring point

**Interconnection Points (8 nodes)**:
- **INTERCON01** through **INTERCON08** - Network interconnection points

**Zone Meters (2 nodes)**:
- **ZONE01** (LIBERTA) - Zone meter
- **ZONE02** (STADIO) - Zone meter

### Key Metrics Generated
For each node, the following metrics were generated:
- **Volume** (M3) - Cumulative water volume
- **Flow Rate** (L/S) - Water flow rate
- **Pressure** (BAR) - System pressure
- **Temperature** (GRD. C) - Water temperature

## Data Quality

### Synthetic Data Markers
All synthetic data has been marked with:
- `is_interpolated = true`
- `quality_score = 0.85`
- `raw_data` JSON field containing:
  - `source: 'synthetic_gap_fill'`
  - `gap_period: [start to end dates]`
  - `generation_date: [timestamp]`

### Validation
- All values are within realistic bounds based on historical min/max
- Consumption patterns follow historical hourly patterns
- Volume accumulation is consistent with observed rates

## Files Generated

1. **data_patterns.json** - Analyzed patterns from historical data
2. **synthetic_data.csv** - Sample synthetic data (for review)
3. **hourly_patterns.png** - Visualization of hourly patterns
4. **tank_volume_trend.png** - Tank volume trend visualization

## Database Impact

- **Total Records Added**: 178,848
  - Gap filling for 4 original nodes: 50,688 records
  - Complete data for 10 new nodes: 128,160 records
- **Time Range**: 30-minute intervals (48 records per day)
- **Nodes Updated**: 14 (ALL nodes in the system)
- **Coverage**: 100% complete from Nov 2024 to Aug 2025

## Usage Notes

### Identifying Synthetic Data
To query only real data:
```sql
SELECT * FROM water_infrastructure.sensor_readings 
WHERE is_interpolated = false;
```

To query only synthetic data:
```sql
SELECT * FROM water_infrastructure.sensor_readings 
WHERE is_interpolated = true 
AND raw_data->>'source' = 'synthetic_gap_fill';
```

### Data Continuity
The synthetic data ensures continuous time series from November 2024 to August 2025, enabling:
- Uninterrupted dashboards and visualizations
- Complete time-series analysis
- Proper ML model training without gaps
- Realistic testing scenarios

## Next Steps

1. **Validation**: Review the synthetic data patterns in dashboards
2. **ML Training**: Use the complete dataset for model training
3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts to distinguish real vs synthetic data
4. **Documentation**: Update system docs to note synthetic data periods
