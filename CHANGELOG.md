# Changelog

All notable changes to the Abbanoa Water Infrastructure Monitoring System will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2025-07-04

### Added

#### Architecture
- Complete project restructure following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles
- Implemented clean architecture with clear layer separation:
  - **Domain Layer**: Core business entities, value objects, and domain services
  - **Application Layer**: Use cases, DTOs, and application interfaces
  - **Infrastructure Layer**: Repository implementations, external services, and persistence
  - **Presentation Layer**: Web dashboard, CLI, and REST API
- Dependency injection using `dependency-injector` for loose coupling
- Repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Event-driven architecture with domain events

#### Domain Model
- Core entities:
  - `SensorReading`: Time-series sensor measurements
  - `MonitoringNode`: Physical monitoring locations
  - `WaterNetwork`: Network of interconnected nodes
- Value objects for type safety:
  - Measurements: `FlowRate`, `Pressure`, `Temperature`, `Volume`
  - Location: `NodeLocation`, `Coordinates`
  - Quality: `DataQualityMetrics`
- Domain services:
  - `AnomalyDetectionService`: Statistical anomaly detection
  - `NetworkEfficiencyService`: Network efficiency calculations

#### Features
- **Anomaly Detection**: Real-time detection of unusual patterns in sensor data
- **Consumption Analysis**: Pattern analysis (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Network Efficiency**: Calculate water loss and identify leakage zones
- **Data Quality Monitoring**: Track data coverage and quality metrics

#### User Interfaces
- **Streamlit Dashboard**: Interactive web interface with real-time monitoring
- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for data operations and analysis
- **REST API**: FastAPI-based programmatic access with OpenAPI documentation

#### Development Tools
- Comprehensive test suite with pytest
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Development tools: Black, isort, flake8, mypy, pylint
- Makefile for common operations
- Documentation with Sphinx

### Changed
- Migrated from script-based architecture to DDD with clean architecture
- Replaced DataFrame-centric approach with rich domain models
- Improved error handling with domain-specific exceptions
- Enhanced type safety with Pydantic models and type hints

### Technical Details
- Python 3.12+ support
- Poetry for dependency management
- Google BigQuery integration for data persistence
- Docker support for containerized deployment
- Environment-based configuration

### Migration Guide
- Use `scripts/migrate_existing_code.py` to move legacy files
- Update imports to use new package structure
- Replace direct DataFrame operations with domain entities
- Use dependency injection for service dependencies

## [0.1.0] - 2024-11-15

### Added
- Initial implementation of water infrastructure monitoring
- Basic data normalization scripts
- BigQuery data pipeline
- Simple Streamlit dashboard
- Time series analysis capabilities
- CSV data import functionality
