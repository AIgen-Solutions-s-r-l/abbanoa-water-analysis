## [1.1.0.0] - 2025-07-04

### Added
- **"Last Year" Time Range**: New option to analyze full year of historical data
- **Custom Date Range Selector**: Pick any date range within available data (Nov 2024 - Mar 2025)
- **Real-Time Node Status**: Live flow rate and pressure readings in Overview tab
- **Automatic Authentication**: Auto-detection of Google Cloud Application Default Credentials
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error messages and debugging information
- **Data Availability Notice**: Clear indication of available data range in sidebar

### Changed
- **Overview Tab**: Complete rewrite to fetch real BigQuery data
  - Real flow rate trends with actual sensor data
  - Live node status cards with current metrics
  - Proper data aggregation for efficiency calculations
- **Consumption Tab**: Direct repository access for better performance
  - Removed use case dependency for simpler data flow
  - Added success messages when data is loaded
  - Fixed DataFrame pivoting for multiple nodes
- **Authentication Flow**: Improved BigQuery connection handling
  - Support for both ADC and service account keys
  - Automatic fallback to default credentials
  - Clear authentication status in run script

### Fixed
- **Flow Rate Trends**: Overview tab now displays real sensor data instead of empty charts
- **Node Status**: Fixed hardcoded "No Data" to show actual node metrics
- **BigQuery Authentication**: Resolved MalformedError with Application Default Credentials
- **Data Access**: Fixed attribute access for sensor readings (flow_rate, pressure, volume)
- **Custom Date Range**: Properly handles date selection and passes to data fetchers
- **Poetry Dependencies**: All required packages properly installed in virtual environment

### Improved
- **Performance**: Optimized data fetching with proper async handling
- **User Feedback**: Added success messages and data counters
- **Code Quality**: Removed unused synthetic data generation methods
- **Documentation**: Updated README with clear setup instructions

## [1.0.0.0] - 2025-07-04

### Added
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Architecture**: Complete restructure with clean architecture principles
  - Domain layer with entities, value objects, and services
  - Application layer with use cases and DTOs
  - Infrastructure layer with repositories and external services
  - Presentation layer with multiple interfaces (Web, API, CLI)
- **Integrated Streamlit Dashboard**: Unified dashboard with 6 main tabs
  - Overview: Real-time system metrics and alerts
  - Forecast: ML-powered 7-day predictions
  - Anomaly Detection: Real-time anomaly monitoring
  - Consumption Patterns: Historical analysis and trends
  - Network Efficiency: Performance metrics and KPIs
  - Reports: Automated report generation
- **BigQuery Integration**: Direct connection to production data warehouse
  - Normalized view `v_sensor_readings_normalized`
  - Support for existing `sensor_data` table
  - Static monitoring node repository
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean dependency management with dependency-injector
- **No Synthetic Data**: Pure real-data visualization
  - Removed all random data generation
  - Shows actual data from November 2024 - March 2025
  - Empty states when no data available

### Changed
- **Architecture**: From monolithic scripts to DDD layers
- **Data Access**: From direct BigQuery queries to repository pattern
- **Dashboard**: From separate dashboard to integrated multi-tab interface
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration with DI container
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling across all layers

### Fixed
- ImportError issues with Location/Coordinates value objects
- Streamlit caching issues with self parameters
- Abstract method implementation in repository classes
- Date/time handling to avoid synthetic current dates

### Removed
- Old dashboard implementation (`legacy/` directory)
- Synthetic data generation in all components
- Direct BigQuery client usage in favor of repositories
- Hardcoded configuration values
