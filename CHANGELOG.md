## [1.1.0.0] - 2025-07-04

### Added
- **"Last Year" Time Range**: New option to analyze full year of historical data
- **Custom Date Range Selector**: Pick any date range within available data (Nov 2024 - Mar 2025)
- **Real-Time Node Status**: Live flow rate and pressure readings in Overview tab
- **Automatic Authentication**: Auto-detection of Google Cloud Application Default Credentials
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error messages and debugging information
- **Data Availability Notice**: Clear indication of available data range in sidebar

### Changed
- **Overview Tab**: Complete rewrite to fetch real BigQuery data
  - Real flow rate trends with actual sensor data
  - Live node status cards with current metrics
  - Proper data aggregation for efficiency calculations
