## üìä Key Integration Points

### 1. Water Balance Analysis

**Formula:** `System Efficiency = (Consumption / Supply) √ó 100`

```typescript
interface WaterBalance {
  supply: {
    totalFlowIn: number;      // From nodes (L/s)
    reservoirLevels: number;  // From SCADA (m¬≥)
  };
  demand: {
    totalConsumption: number; // From consumption data (L/day)
    peakDemand: number;       // Peak hour consumption (L/hr)
  };
  losses: {
    physicalLosses: number;   // Leaks, pipe breaks
    commercialLosses: number; // Meter errors, theft
  };
}
```

**Current State (with synthetic data):**
- Total Daily Supply: ~30,000,000 L
- Total Daily Consumption: ~27,600,000 L
- System Efficiency: 92%
- Water Loss: 8% (2% physical, 6% commercial)

### 2. Pressure-Consumption Correlation

The system now correlates pressure readings with consumption patterns:

```python
# Pressure Impact on Consumption
def pressure_consumption_model(pressure, base_consumption):
    """
    Low pressure (<2 bar): Reduced consumption
    Optimal pressure (3-4 bar): Normal consumption  
    High pressure (>5 bar): Increased losses
    """
    if pressure < 2:
        return base_consumption * 0.7
    elif pressure > 5:
        return base_consumption * 1.15  # Including losses
    else:
        return base_consumption
```

### 3. Anomaly Detection Enhancement

**Before Integration:**
- Only infrastructure anomalies (pressure drops, flow spikes)
- Reactive approach
- Limited context

**After Integration:**
- Consumption anomalies (excessive usage, zero consumption)
- Infrastructure + consumption correlation
- Predictive maintenance triggers
- Customer-specific insights
