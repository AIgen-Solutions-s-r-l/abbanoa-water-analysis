## Key Technical Concepts

### Three-Tier Storage Strategy
1. **Hot Tier (Redis)**: Real-time data, <50ms access
2. **Warm Tier (PostgreSQL)**: Recent data, indexed queries
3. **Cold Tier (BigQuery)**: Historical data, analytics

### Processing Architecture
- **Batch Processing**: 30-minute cycles for sensor data
- **Stream Processing**: Real-time anomaly detection
- **ML Pipeline**: Automated model training and deployment

### API Design
- **RESTful**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- **Pagination**: Cursor-based for large datasets
- **Caching**: Multi-level caching strategy
- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket algorithm

### Performance Targets
- API Response Time: <50ms (p95)
- Data Processing Latency: <5 minutes
- Dashboard Load Time: <2 seconds
- System Availability: 99.9%
