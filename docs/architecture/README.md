# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains architectural documentation for the Abbanoa Water Infrastructure Analytics Platform.

## Documents

### [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
Comprehensive system architecture documentation including:
- High-level system design
- Component architecture
- Data flow and storage strategies
- Security and scalability considerations
- Technology stack overview

## Quick Links

- [Technical Documentation](../technical/) - Detailed technical implementation guides
- [API Documentation](http://localhost:8000/docs) - OpenAPI documentation (when service is running)
- [Migration Guides](../migration/) - Database and system migration documentation

## Architecture Principles

1. **Domain-Driven Design** - Organization around business domains
2. **Microservices Architecture** - Loosely coupled, independently deployable services
3. **Three-Tier Data Storage** - Optimized storage based on access patterns
4. **Container-First** - All services containerized for consistency and scalability
5. **API-First Design** - RESTful APIs for all service communication

## Key Design Decisions

- **Python-based Stack**: Leverages Python's data science ecosystem
- **Multi-tier Storage**: Balances performance and cost
- **ML Integration**: Built-in machine learning capabilities
- **Real-time Processing**: Support for both batch and stream processing
- **Cloud-Native**: Designed for cloud deployment (GCP)
