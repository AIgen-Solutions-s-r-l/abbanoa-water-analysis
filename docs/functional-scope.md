### Executive Summary

This document defines the functional scope for the Abbanoa water network optimization project, establishing clear boundaries, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and success criteria for the implementation.

### Project Objectives

1. **Predictive Analytics**: Implement 7-day forecasting for critical water network metrics
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Establish continuous monitoring of network performance
3. **Operational Optimization**: Provide actionable insights for network management
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Early detection of potential issues and anomalies

### Functional Scope

#### In Scope
- **KPI Monitoring**: Flow rate, reservoir levels, and pressure monitoring
- **Predictive Modeling**: 7-day horizon forecasting for all defined KPIs
- **Pilot Implementation**: Two selected districts for initial deployment
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Web-based monitoring interface
- **Alerting System**: Automated notifications for threshold breaches
- **Historical Analysis**: Trend analysis and pattern recognition

#### Out of Scope
